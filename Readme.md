# **Next JS**
In this repository I will push code of my Next Js learning
I will mention my progress here whenever i contribute to this repository

## Day 1
I created next JS app and learned about its folder structure

## Day 2
I learnt the routes of Next JS how to create routes and nested routes.
For the route to create just create a folder of that name, inside it create a file of page.ex and write all your code in it.
