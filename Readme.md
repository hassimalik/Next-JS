# **Next JS**
In this repository I will push code of my Next Js learning
I will mention my progress here whenever i contribute to this repository

## Day 1
I created next JS app and learned about its folder structure

## Day 2
*December 31 2025*

I learnt the routes of Next JS how to create routes and nested routes.
For the route to create just create a folder of that name, inside it create a file of page.ex and write all your code in it.
## Day 3 

*1 Jan 2026*

I created routes of folders and of a new type of id based folder which works as a dynamic route.
In this the team name will be same as of id that it gets or it chose.


## Day 4

*January 2 2026*

I learnt that if u created a dynamic route then all the dynamic values/urls/routes can be accessible only to that specific dynamic url.Then i learnt how to render them from map and use the dynamic ids for instance i created teams then i used these names and ids also their colors.I created teams of PSL as an example.
